# AI_1

AI_1 is a Python project that explores various artificial intelligence algorithms and data structures, focusing on:

- **Genetic Algorithm**: Implementation of genetic algorithm.
- **Simulated Annealing Algorithm**: Implementation of the simulated annealing algorithm.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This project requires Python 3.6 or higher.

## Usage

1. **Running the Main Script**:

   Execute the `main.py` script to run the implemented algorithms:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This will perform classification on the provided dataset and display the results.

2. **Visualizing Results**:

   The `plotter.py` script can be used to visualize the outcomes of the algorithms. Ensure that the necessary plotting libraries (e.g., Matplotlib) are installed.
